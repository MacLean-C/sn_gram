A simple string parser that returns a list containing BoW-style n-grams. The particularity of these n-grams is that they contain syntactic neighbors of noun/verb heads in order to increase the pertinence of generated n-grams and reduce the size of the BoW. This parser is currently used to preprocess text corpora for topic modeling using BoW-based topic models.
